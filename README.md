# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. The game can be played by two players on the same machine through the terminal. This project is perfect for understanding basic game logic, handling user input, and using basic control structures in C++.

## How to Run the Game

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `g++` (GNU C++ compiler) installed. If not, install MinGW-w64 (Windows) or use `g++` from your package manager (Linux/Mac).
- Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ranamusab1/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Open the Project in VS Code**

   ```sh
   code .
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**

   Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to compile the code using VS Code's build task, or use the terminal:

   ```sh
   g++ -o tic-tac-toe main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Game**

   ```sh
   ./tic-tac-toe
   ```

### Gameplay

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.
- Players take turns to enter their move.
- The game checks for a winner after each move and announces the result when a player wins or the game is a draw.
